<h1>Guess the Word Game </h1>

<p>Guess the Word Game allows users to interact with the code by giving them a limited number of guesses toward the mystery word. It starts with a random word on the screen with circular symbols acting as placeholders for each letter. Players start by guessing a letter and if they guess correctly, the letter appears in the word. If they guess incorrectly, they learn how many guesses they have remaining. </p>

<p>The game shows the player which letters they’ve already guessed. It detects and lets the player know if they’ve already guessed a letter or entered a non-alphabetic character. If the player guesses all the letters correctly before they use up their allotted guesses, they win! A Play Again button appears at the end of the game to prompt the player to play another round. The game features an API call to fetch a text file with over 800 of the most common English words.</p>
